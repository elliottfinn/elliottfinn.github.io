I was raised in Corvallis, Oregon on the ancestral lands and waters of the Kalapuya. I grew up hosting berry researchers from around the world [insert link], raising hogs in 4-H, mushroom hunting the Coast Range, and exploring the forests and hills in the Willamette Valley. Before graduate school I spent a few years building Passive Houses and worked and traveled throughout Europe and South America, most extensively in Turkey and Colombia. When not in the office you can find me hiking and backpacking across public lands in the West, gardening, or cooking tasty food.
