**<font size="6">Cultivating Political Literacy and Action:</font>**\
We need passionate students who can think and act politically to create policy solutions to complex ecological and social problems like climate change and polarization. Fostering studentsâ€™ passion and helping them develop skills to think and act politically is why I teach. Students learn how to evaluate the interconnected causes of distributional and environmental problems and create political solutions by getting their hands dirty. My courses center applied, student driven learning by having students apply data and research to problems they care about. Then, I build supportive learning environments using responsive teaching and scaffolding. As a first time Instructor of Record during the pandemic, students gave me marks that were above the average for the School (and this school highly values effective teaching) and in 2022-2023 I was recognized as an honorable mention for the Graduate Student Association Teaching Excellence award.\

**Connection and Safety** I believe in teaching materials and skills that respond to my students interests and needs. 
My classrooms are welcoming and supportive because I build community by supporting marginalized students, encouraging considerate dialogue, and fostering critical analysis. I [survey]() student's needs and interests, create inclusive environments for learning by setting [norms](LINK to Norm activity or SYLLABUs), [reflecting during](LINK MIDCOURSE EVAL) and [after](LINK post course), creating classes that use diverse materials [LINk to written/podcast/video/]() and center [marginalized communities' perspectives and experiences](LINK Land curriculum, EJ integration into ENERGY)./

**Structure**
My courses build students' capacity to think more systematically about both environmental and political problems,  gain important professional skills, analyze data, and create solutions to contemporary problems. I design my classes and assignments using [universal design principals](LINK) and use a diversity of assignments- from [essays and policy memos](energy policy memo LINK) to [problem sets and exams](energy pol p-sets, spatial voting p-set) to [public presentations](ESM early presentations LINK) and [creative projects](LINK to Campaign Targeting assignment) to engage and assess my students. My classes and assignments are [scaffolded](LINK ENERGY Policy Memo) to build knowledge and confidence. Students work individually and collaboratively and I use different classroom formats. I use both traditional lectures and [flipped classrooms](LINK TO ESM inclass)./

**Co-Creating Knowledge and Creating Solutions to Real Problems**
Students inspire my hope that we can heal historical harms to both people and the environment and design new solutions and policies. Students consistently teach me new specifics about environmental problems that I didn't know about and create uniqe analyses of past problems and creative new solutions. Here are some examples of the kinds of projects that students have created in classes I designed or helped design: [Campaign Video](LINK), [Billboards](link), [Radio](), [Partnering with NGO Analysis](LINK), [problem sets](LINK), [](LInk)./
