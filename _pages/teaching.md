**Teaching Experience**
**<font size="5">Graduate courses</font>**
I taught courses and independent sections at the University of California at Santa Barbara at both the undergraduate (lower and upper division) and graduate (Master of Environmental Science and Management Program) levels. In addition, I worked for the Colombian government teaching spoken English to teachers and co-teaching English classes in public high schools as well as leadership and environmental science to students in the Colorado backcountry.

**Teaching Philosophy in Brief**

I love sharing my passion for environmental politics, land management, environmental science, and history with my students. I believe in teaching materials and skills that respond to my students interests and needs. 
My classrooms are welcoming and supportive because I build community by supporting marginalized students, encouraging considerate dialogue, and fostering critical analysis. [EVIDENCE LINKS: pre/mid course surveys, syllabi w/diverse sources etc].

I design my classes and assignments using universal design principals [link] and use a diversity of assignments- from essays [energy policy memo link] to problem sets [energy pol p-sets, spatial voting p-set] to presentation [ESM early presentations] to creative projects [advertising campaigns, podcasts, video/radio, billboards] to engage and assess my students. My classes and assignments are scaffolded to build knowledge and confidence [link to energy memo].

I build hands-on, interactive, structured classes using scaffolded assignments,  hands on data analysis, creative projects,  
Students inspire my hope that we can heal historical harms to both people and the environment and design new solutions and policies. My classes use real data and ask students to solve problems by combining social and environmental science and my courses help students think more systematically about both environmental and political problems,  gain important professional skills with collaborative and individual projects, writing, data analysis, and _____.  

I loved “consploring” the woods around our subdivision with my enthusiastic dad. I chose the places we walked, and Dad taught me how to pet lethargic bumblebees on cold days and identify flowers and fungi genera from phaecilia to cantharellus. He answered innumerable questions and guided me through field guides to answer questions that stumped him. Over time our consploring range expanded to public lands across the West where Dad helped me through dozens of Jr. Ranger programs, and we both expanded our understanding of the spaces we loved. The way Dad and me consplored is how I try to teach. I am a passionate and supportive guide who develops structured learning experiences that resonate with students with various backgrounds and responsively adapts to student interests and new conditions.
