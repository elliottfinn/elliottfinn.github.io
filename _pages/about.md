I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara. I live in Goleta, CA and work at UCSB which are located on unceded Indigenous Chumash ancestral lands and waters. Please consider financially supporting the yak titʸu titʸu yak tiłhini, Northern Chumash’s efforts to preserve their language and land back fund via their [ytt Northern Chumash Nonprofit](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=6AJAB9ZWSPWM4) and/or find out whose ancestral lands and waters you work and live on at: https://native-land.ca/

I study the institutional roots of identity group grievances, federal government resentment, support for anti-establishment political behaviors and candidates, and conflict over environmental policy and management. I am particularly interested in understanding how the historical relationships between communities and institutions shape public opinion, political behavior, and environmental outcomes in the American West. My research sheds light on how contemporary actors within institutions and interest groups can tailor their behaviors to best address historically rooted social and environmental problems.

I use the historical role federal land jurisdiction and management played in shaping political behavior and identity in the Western U.S. to investigate these topics. As an interdisciplinary scholar and mixed-methods researcher, I use qualitative interviews and historical policy process tracing methods alongside quantitative surveys, geospatial, and design-based causal inference methods to approach these topics.

My [job market paper](INSERT LINK) examines the effects of historical public land management policy changes on anti-federalism beliefs via support for constitutional sheriffs and the shift towards Republican Party dominance in rural Western communities. 

I teach to share my passion and knowledge about environmental politics, land management, environmental science, and public lands history with my students, to learn from my students' experiences and perspectives, and to create solutions. My classes use real data, contemporary and historical cases, and are scaffolded to build students' knowledge and skills in a structured manner. I use varied materials from a range of perspectives and root my pedagogy in _________. In my classes and sections, we learn how to integrate social and environmental sciences to understand the past, create contemporary solutions, and envision a better future.

Ongoing research projects explore both the historical processes that create governance nostalgia as well as the contemporary distribution and prevalence of governance nostalgia. I also collaborate on projects which investigate the antecedents of climate change opinions and beliefs.

I have mentored Honors thesis projects, developed backcountry, experiential environmental science learning materials, speak fluent Spanish, and bring a _person-centric_____ philosophy to my studies.


<!--tudies the intersections between policy and policymakers, local organizations, and individuals. Who controls the resources and makes land management or policy decisions, and how are benefits through use, non-use, or extraction distributed? As an undergraduate Elliott investigated the connections between individuals’ outdoor recreation participation, place of residence, and environmental worldviews. For the last three years, Elliott worked and traveled throughout Europe and South America, most extensively in Turkey and Colombia. When not in the office Elliott can be found hiking and backpacking across the public lands he enjoys studying. -->


<!--I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara, and a <a href="https://ucigcc.org/people/vincent-thivierge/">2022-2023 Dissertation Fellow</a> at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. 

I will be a S.V. Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley ARE next year, before joining the University of Ottawa as an Assistant Professor.

I broadly study the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity impacts of environmental policies for global and local air pollutants. My [job market paper](https://vthivierge.github.io/files/efficiency.pdf) develops an empirical framework for estimating the allocative efficiency changes of environmental markets, and applies it to landmark U.S. air pollution cap-and-trade markets. 

Other ongoing projects examine the effectiveness of carbon tariffs in reducing carbon leakage, and the air pollution and health effects of the energy transition.

I formerly worked as a researcher for think-tanks and University-based policy research institutes in Canada. I thrive to generate rigorous yet policy-relevant research. My work has been cited by the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fsr-june2018.pdf">Bank of Canada</a>, <a href="https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2021/eccc/En4-423-1-2021-eng.pdf">Environment and Climate Change Canada</a>, in the <a href="https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/info/af-ma-eng.aspx?cas=37627">Supreme Court of Canada</a>, the <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/2021/04/21/press-release-carbon-neutrality-studies-identify-potential-paths-for-california-to-reach-2045-goal/">California EPA</a>, and the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/Canada-2021-OECD-economic-survey-overview.pdf">OECD</a>.

I published papers and reports on the impacts of carbon pricing on household gasoline consumption, industry competitiveness, and on the distributional implications for households.-->
