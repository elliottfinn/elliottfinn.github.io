I am a PhD candidate in economics and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara. My current work explores the impacts of environmental policies covering global or local pollutants on allocative efficiency, leakage, and distributional issues. I am a <a href="https://ucigcc.org/people/#fellows">2022-2023 Dissertation Fellow</a> at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation (IGCC).  

I formerly worked as a researcher for think-tanks and University-based policy research institutes in Canada. I thrive to generate rigorous yet policy-relevant research. My work has been cited by the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fsr-june2018.pdf">Bank of Canada</a>, Environment Canada, in the <a href="https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/info/af-ma-eng.aspx?cas=37627">Supreme Court of Canada</a>, the <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/2021/04/21/press-release-carbon-neutrality-studies-identify-potential-paths-for-california-to-reach-2045-goal/"<California EPA</a>, and the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/Canada-2021-OECD-economic-survey-overview.pdf">OECD</a>.

<!--I published papers and reports on the impacts of carbon pricing on household gasoline consumption, industry competitiveness, and on the distributional implications for households.-->
