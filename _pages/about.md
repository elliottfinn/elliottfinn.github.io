I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara, and a <a href="https://ucigcc.org/people/#fellows">2022-2023 Dissertation Fellow</a> at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. I broadly study the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity impacts of environmental policies for global or local air pollutants. My job market paper develops an empirical framework for estimating allocative efficiency changes and applies it to U.S. air pollution cap-and-trade markets. Other ongoing projects examine the effectiveness of carbon tariffs in reducing carbon leakage, and the air pollution and health effects of the energy transition.


I formerly worked as a researcher for think-tanks and University-based policy research institutes in Canada. I thrive to generate rigorous yet policy-relevant research. My work has been cited by the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fsr-june2018.pdf">Bank of Canada</a>, Environment Canada, in the <a href="https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/info/af-ma-eng.aspx?cas=37627">Supreme Court of Canada</a>, the <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/2021/04/21/press-release-carbon-neutrality-studies-identify-potential-paths-for-california-to-reach-2045-goal/"<California EPA</a>, and the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/Canada-2021-OECD-economic-survey-overview.pdf">OECD</a>.

<!--I published papers and reports on the impacts of carbon pricing on household gasoline consumption, industry competitiveness, and on the distributional implications for households.-->
