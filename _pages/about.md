I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara.

I study the underlying causes of conflict over public land management in the American West. 

<!--tudies the intersections between policy and policymakers, local organizations, and individuals. Who controls the resources and makes land management or policy decisions, and how are benefits through use, non-use, or extraction distributed? As an undergraduate Elliott investigated the connections between individualsâ€™ outdoor recreation participation, place of residence, and environmental worldviews. For the last three years, Elliott worked and traveled throughout Europe and South America, most extensively in Turkey and Colombia. When not in the office Elliott can be found hiking and backpacking across the public lands he enjoys studying. -->


<!--I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara, and a <a href="https://ucigcc.org/people/vincent-thivierge/">2022-2023 Dissertation Fellow</a> at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. 

I will be a S.V. Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley ARE next year, before joining the University of Ottawa as an Assistant Professor.

I broadly study the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity impacts of environmental policies for global and local air pollutants. My [job market paper](https://vthivierge.github.io/files/efficiency.pdf) develops an empirical framework for estimating the allocative efficiency changes of environmental markets, and applies it to landmark U.S. air pollution cap-and-trade markets. 

Other ongoing projects examine the effectiveness of carbon tariffs in reducing carbon leakage, and the air pollution and health effects of the energy transition.

I formerly worked as a researcher for think-tanks and University-based policy research institutes in Canada. I thrive to generate rigorous yet policy-relevant research. My work has been cited by the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fsr-june2018.pdf">Bank of Canada</a>, <a href="https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2021/eccc/En4-423-1-2021-eng.pdf">Environment and Climate Change Canada</a>, in the <a href="https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/info/af-ma-eng.aspx?cas=37627">Supreme Court of Canada</a>, the <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/2021/04/21/press-release-carbon-neutrality-studies-identify-potential-paths-for-california-to-reach-2045-goal/">California EPA</a>, and the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/Canada-2021-OECD-economic-survey-overview.pdf">OECD</a>.

I published papers and reports on the impacts of carbon pricing on household gasoline consumption, industry competitiveness, and on the distributional implications for households.-->
