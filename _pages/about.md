I am a PhD candidate in economics and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara. I formerly worked as a researcher for think-tanks and University-based policy research institutes in Canada.

My recent work has explored the impacts of carbon pricing on household gasoline consumption, industry competitiveness, and on the distributional implications for households.
