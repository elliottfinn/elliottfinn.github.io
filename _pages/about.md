I am a PhD candidate in economics and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara. My current work explores the impacts of environmental policies covering global or local pollutants on allocative efficiency, leakage, and distributional issues.  

I formerly worked as a researcher for think-tanks and University-based policy research institutes in Canada. In my former work I published papers and reports on the impacts of carbon pricing on household gasoline consumption, industry competitiveness, and on the distributional implications for households.
