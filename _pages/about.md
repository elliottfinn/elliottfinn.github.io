I am a Ph.D. candidate, trained in Political Science (M.A. Political Science, American Politics w/distinction), in the interdisciplinary Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and the University of California- Santa Barbara. I live in Goleta, CA and work at UCSB which are located on unceded Indigenous Chumash ancestral lands and waters.\

Creating effective policy solutions for the 21st century requires understanding the contemporary and historical roots of political conflict. My interdisiplinary research examines how historical policy change shapes contemporary political actions and students leave my classes with experience applying data and contemporary research to issues they care about and confident they can facilitate the solutions we need.\

**Research**
I study the role public policy plays in empowering identity groups that can be mobilized. My book-style dissertation investigates this question by combining quasi-experimental and qualitative research methods to identify the causes and consequences of policy conflict in the American West. I show that changes in federal land use policies created grievances among institutionally privileged groups and elites mobilize these grievances into anti-establishment behaviors. Policy changes make these groups and communities receptive to nostalgic appeals today. My [job market paper](INSERT LINK) examines the effects of federal land policy changes on governance nostalgia- DEFINE , anti-establishment beliefs and behaviors via support for constitutional sheriffs, Republican Party sorting, and Tea Party support in rural communities in the West.\

I am particularly interested in understanding how historical group power and conflict over policy shape public opinion, political behavior, and environmental outcomes more broadly. My research sheds light on how contemporary actors within institutions and interest groups can tailor their behavior and policies to address historically rooted social and environmental conflict.\

**Teaching**
We need passionate students who can think and act politically to create policy solutions to complex ecological and social problems like climate change and polarization. Centering complex, salient problems in my courses engages students and helps them learn to evaluate the interconnected causes of distributional and environmental problems. Then, having students apply data and research to those problems and issues they care about creates authentic learning opportunities and generates ownership in their learning. To get my students to these higher order goals, I use responsive teaching and scaffolding which builds supportive learning environments.\

I have mentored Honors thesis projects, speak fluent Spanish, and look forward to meeting you!\

<!--tudies the intersections between policy and policymakers, local organizations, and individuals. Who controls the resources and makes land management or policy decisions, and how are benefits through use, non-use, or extraction distributed? As an undergraduate Elliott investigated the connections between individuals’ outdoor recreation participation, place of residence, and environmental worldviews. For the last three years, Elliott worked and traveled throughout Europe and South America, most extensively in Turkey and Colombia. When not in the office Elliott can be found hiking and backpacking across the public lands he enjoys studying. -->


<!--I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara, and a <a href="https://ucigcc.org/people/vincent-thivierge/">2022-2023 Dissertation Fellow</a> at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. 

I will be a S.V. Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley ARE next year, before joining the University of Ottawa as an Assistant Professor.

I broadly study the efficiency, effectiveness, and equity impacts of environmental policies for global and local air pollutants. My [job market paper](https://vthivierge.github.io/files/efficiency.pdf) develops an empirical framework for estimating the allocative efficiency changes of environmental markets, and applies it to landmark U.S. air pollution cap-and-trade markets. 

Other ongoing projects examine the effectiveness of carbon tariffs in reducing carbon leakage, and the air pollution and health effects of the energy transition.

I formerly worked as a researcher for think-tanks and University-based policy research institutes in Canada. I thrive to generate rigorous yet policy-relevant research. My work has been cited by the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fsr-june2018.pdf">Bank of Canada</a>, <a href="https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2021/eccc/En4-423-1-2021-eng.pdf">Environment and Climate Change Canada</a>, in the <a href="https://www.scc-csc.ca/case-dossier/info/af-ma-eng.aspx?cas=37627">Supreme Court of Canada</a>, the <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/2021/04/21/press-release-carbon-neutrality-studies-identify-potential-paths-for-california-to-reach-2045-goal/">California EPA</a>, and the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/economy/surveys/Canada-2021-OECD-economic-survey-overview.pdf">OECD</a>.

I published papers and reports on the impacts of carbon pricing on household gasoline consumption, industry competitiveness, and on the distributional implications for households.-->
