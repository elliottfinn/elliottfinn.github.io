I am a PhD candidate in economics and environmental science at UC Santa Barbara. My current work explores the impacts of environmental policies covering global or local pollutants on allocative efficiency, leakage, and distributional issues. I am a <a href="https://ucigcc.org/people/#fellows">2022-2023 Dissertation Fellow</a> at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation (IGCC).  

I formerly worked as a researcher for think-tanks and University-based policy research institutes in Canada. I thrive to generate rigorous yet policy-relevant research. I have been fortunate to have my work cited by the Bank of Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Office of the Governor of California.  

<!--I published papers and reports on the impacts of carbon pricing on household gasoline consumption, industry competitiveness, and on the distributional implications for households.-->
