**<font size="5">Research and Writing Tools</font>**
I have created some tools to help students in my classes over the years. Check out these links for help reading faster, taking better notes, organizing your research for class projects, writing more concisely, and more.\
**Organization, Notes, and More**\
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/?interaction_required=true) are great resources for organizing your research. [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app) and [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) are helpful for organizing and taking digital notes. Here some notetaking templates I've created for students- [Book Notes](INSERT LINK), [article notes](INSERT LINK). These [slides](INSERT LINK) offer some tips on how to use these resources. The [UCSB library](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/services/undergraduates) offers many resources and provides [individual appointments](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/student-research-support) for students./
**Writing Tools:**Policy Memos: Writing a policy memo is different from writing an essay. [This document](LINK to PM VS essay) describes some of those differences. For citation and general writing advice check out these links [CITATIons](), [Concise writing](), [Common errors when writing about politics]()./
